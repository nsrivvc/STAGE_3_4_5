dedup.py -- phase 1 of stage 3: drop the rows we have already seen.
==================================================================
Every fetch lands a fresh batch in Bronze, duplicates and all. This phase
copies Bronze into staging and keeps ONE copy of each distinct row:

    firm           bronze.gtran_firm -> silver_staging.firm_dedup
    interruptible  bronze.gtran_it   -> silver_staging.interruptible_dedup
    awards         bronze.gawd       -> silver_staging.awards_dedup

(IOC has no dedup on purpose -- deduplication covers these three feeds only.)

HOW A DUPLICATE IS DECIDED -- right here, nowhere else
------------------------------------------------------
Two rows are duplicates when EVERY DATA FIELD MATCHES EXACTLY. The comparison
is self-contained in transform_sql below; it does not depend on anything any
earlier stage computed.

The one wrinkle: every Bronze row also carries the pipeline's own bookkeeping
(row id, run id, load timestamps, file name...). Two copies of the same
contract always differ there, because they arrived in different runs. So those
stamp columns are set aside (LOAD_STAMPS below) and the comparison covers
everything else -- the actual data.

In SQL that reads:

    to_jsonb(row) - LOAD_STAMPS      -- the row as {column: value}, stamps removed

    * DISTINCT ON (that)             -- one copy per distinct content in the batch
    * WHERE NOT EXISTS (same content -- and no copy already in the staging table
      already in staging)               from an earlier run

Rows that survive both checks are inserted into the staging table on Neon.
Nothing is ever deleted: Bronze keeps its duplicates (it is the full history),
and staging simply never receives a second copy.

WHY `LIKE`
----------
The target is created with `CREATE TABLE ... (LIKE <bronze table>)`, cloning
the source's columns without naming them, so this file needs no column list
and keeps working as the Bronze schema evolves.

Output goes to DECOMP_SCHEMA (default `silver_staging`), which is what
ammendments(p2), decompisition(p3) and stage 4 read.
