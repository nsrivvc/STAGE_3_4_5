amend_base.py
=============
Shared base for the ammendments phase (p2 of stage 3). Not a transformation
itself -- it registers nothing. One subclass per feed (firm, interruptible,
awards) sets column names; the logic here is identical for all three.

WHAT IS BEING AMENDED
---------------------
A contract (or award), identified by (contract id, TSP id). The source
re-posts the same contract over time; this phase folds those postings into
ONE current row per contract, keeping superseded versions as Void.

THE RULES -- the whole phase in four sentences
----------------------------------------------
1. Only postings still marked 'fresh' are consumed (stage 2 stamps the
   marker; an empty target replays the full history instead).
2. The FIRST-EVER instance of a contract is ALWAYS APPENDED, no matter what
   its descriptor says -- it IS the initial contract.
3. Every LATER instance is treated per the TSP's declared reporting mode,
   joined from the PIPELINE ATTRIBUTES table on the TSP id: 'All Data'
   replaces the running state wholesale, 'Changes Only' overlays just its
   non-NULL fields. (No attributes row -> the posting's own descriptor; no
   usable descriptor either -> 'All Data' behaviour, latest posting wins.)
4. The LATEST resulting state (by posting timestamp) is the row that lands
   as the new Current version; the old Current flips to Void, and every
   consumed source row flips 'fresh' -> 'processed'.

In SQL that replay collapses to: the latest full restatement per contract is
the baseline ("anchor"), changes posted after it overlay it column-by-column
(latest non-NULL wins), and a contract sending only changes overlays its
previous Current row instead.

THE PIPELINE ATTRIBUTES TABLE
-----------------------------
`<DECOMP_SCHEMA>.pipeline_attributes` -- one row per TSP, keyed by DUNS,
declaring how that pipeline reports amendments:

    tspduns      tspname                   amendment_reporting
    -----------  ------------------------  -------------------
    007933021    Texas Gas Transmission    Changes Only

The DDL creates it empty (shared by every feed); populate it by hand as
pipelines' modes become known. A TSP missing from it falls back to
per-posting descriptors, so an empty table changes nothing. The AmendRptgDesc
field on the affected postings is rewritten to the joined value, so
downstream sees the label that was acted on. `assert_pipeline_attributes()`
runs before any row is written and fails the run if a row carries a mode the
join would not recognize.

Its table name, column names, and the accepted mode spellings all live in
core/table_config.py (PipelineAttributes) -- change them there, and the DDL,
the join, the classify CASEs and the assert below all follow.

Because the target accumulates versions and the source markers flip, this
transformation sets `incremental = True`: the runner never drops the table on
--reload. To rebuild from scratch, drop the table manually -- the next run
replays the full history.
