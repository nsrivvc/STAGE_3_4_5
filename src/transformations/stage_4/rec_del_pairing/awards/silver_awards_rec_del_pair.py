silver_awards_rec_del_pair.py
=============================
Rec-del pairing for the AWARDS feed: `<DECOMP_SCHEMA>.awards_locations` ->
`silver.awards_rec_del_pair`.

See ../pairing_base.py for the pairing itself and the two SPEC hooks.

COLUMN MAP
----------
The awards locations grain has its own agreed schema and shares no column names
with firm/IT, so every logical field is remapped:

    contract_key   awardnumber          the award, not the location. Each element
                                        carries its own `Id`
                                        ("...-AWARD-2026-000001-LOC-01"), which
                                        identifies the LOCATION -- pairing needs
                                        the thing both sides have in common.
    loc_code       locationpropcode
    loc_name       locationname
    loc_zone       None                 awards carries no zone at all; the output
                                        column stays NULL rather than borrowing
                                        an unrelated field (see pairing_base.ref)
    loc_purpose    locationpurposecode  already 'REC' / 'DEL', so the base's
                                        default purpose values apply unchanged
    loc_qti        locationquantitytypeindicator
    loc_qty        awardquantitylocation
    term_begin     releasetermstartdate the award-level release term, carried
    term_end       releasetermenddate   onto each element as a parent column
                                        (elements have only a SEASONAL window)

TODO(confirm): `term_begin` / `term_end` use the release term rather than the
element's SeasonalStartDate / SeasonalEndDate. The release term is the award's
actual contract window and matches what firm/IT pass through; the seasonal
dates are a narrower sub-window. Confirm which the term transform should see.
