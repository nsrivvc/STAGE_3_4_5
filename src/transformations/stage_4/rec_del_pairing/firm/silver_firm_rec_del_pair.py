silver_firm_rec_del_pair.py
===========================
Rec-del pairing for FIRM transport.

Source: the firm locations table produced by the decomposition phase.
All pairing and term logic lives in the shared base -- see pairing_base.py in this package,
where the two `SPEC:` hooks are waiting for the business rules.

TODO(confirm): the `column_map` overrides below are set to
the expected decomposition output. Verify both once that phase lands.
