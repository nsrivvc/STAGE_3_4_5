"""
silver_awards_rates_master_capacity.py
======================================
Maps the AWARDS feed's stage-3 `awards_rates` onto the shared master capacity
model, producing `silver.awards_rates_master_capacity`.

That model lives in ../../models.py and is shared with the FINAL
transformations, which UNION every feed's table for this grain into one.

`ngh_contract_id` is **AwardNumber** for all three awards grains. The award's own
`Id` identifies the core row, but the locations and rates elements do not carry
it -- they carry OfferNumber / BidNumber / AwardNumber. AwardNumber is the only
key present at every grain, so it is what lets the three join.

Unmapped target columns are emitted as typed NULLs. `SPEC:` markers flag the
mappings that are inferred rather than confirmed against the mapping sheet.

ONE ROW PER LOCATION, NOT PER PATH. A firm rates row already names both ends of
the path (recloc / delloc); an awards rates element names ONE location and flags
it REC or DEL via `LocationPurpose`. The receipt_* / delivery_* columns are
therefore filled by CASE on that flag, leaving the other side NULL, rather than
inventing a pairing this grain does not express.

NOT MAPPED: `reporting_level`, `negotiated_rate_indicator`, the discount window
and the seasonal window -- none exist on an awards rate element.
