=====================================
FINAL Rates — Master Capacity. Consolidates all four feeds' rate master capacity
tables into one.

NO EXISTING TARGET TO MIRROR: there is no `final_rates_master_capacity` table in
the database yet, so the column set below is a SPEC placeholder built from the
rate fields this pipeline already handles (bronze.gtran_rates and
silver.firm_transport_rate). Replace it with the real model when it's settled —
the DDL and the UNION both follow from this list.
