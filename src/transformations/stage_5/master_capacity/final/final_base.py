final_base.py
=============
Shared base for the three FINAL master capacity transformations. Not a
transformation itself -- it registers nothing.

WHAT THESE DO
-------------
Each of the four feeds produces its own per-grain master capacity table. The
FINAL tables tie all four into one consolidated table per grain:

    firm_core_master_capacity           \\
    interruptible_core_master_capacity   >--- UNION ALL ---> final_core_master_capacity
    awards_core_master_capacity         /
    ioc_core_master_capacity           /

...and the same shape again for `locations` and `rates`. Every consolidated row
carries a `source_type` column naming the feed it came from, so a consolidated
table can always be split back apart.

THE CONSOLIDATION ASSUMPTION
----------------------------
A UNION only works if the four per-feed tables share a column set at a given
grain. That is the assumption baked in here: per-feed tables are the same shape,
and the final adds `source_type`. If feeds end up differing, the per-feed
projection is the place to reconcile them -- see `projection_sql`.

HOOKS LEFT FOR THE BUSINESS RULES
---------------------------------
All marked `SPEC:` and currently holding neutral placeholders, so the tables and
the wiring exist before the rules are written:

  1. `columns`        the consolidated column set for this grain.
  2. `natural_key`    what makes a consolidated row unique (drives the upsert).
  3. `projection_sql` how one feed's rows map onto that column set. The
     placeholder assumes identical column names across feeds.
  4. `dedupe_note`    what to do when the same contract appears in more than one
     feed. The placeholder keeps both rows, distinguished by `source_type`.

CONSOLIDATES WHATEVER RAN
-------------------------
A workflow in the orchestration interface can pull any subset of sources -- Firm
alone, Firm + IT, all four. So these do NOT require every feed. At run time they
look up which per-feed tables actually exist and union exactly those, naming the
absent ones in the log.

Requiring all four would leave the FINAL tables permanently blocked for any
workflow that pulls a subset, which is the normal case rather than the exception.
With no feeds present at all, there is nothing to consolidate: it logs and
returns 0 rather than failing, because the workflow is simply ahead of its
inputs.
